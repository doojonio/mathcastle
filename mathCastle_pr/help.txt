  CONTROL:

	Use numbers on the keyboard to type an answer.
	If answer is a negative number use '-'.
	Use "Enter" to accept your answer.
	Use "Esc" for exit from game process.

	P.S.: If you didn't guess 'arrows' are responsible for menu navigation. :D

  RULES:

	There is a core of mathematics. Objects are moving on it.
	When object reaches the core the lives at the core is taken away.
	Objects are mathematical tasks.
	The player requires that objects to the core are not allowed. To do this, he needs to solve the problem
		which is an object and "charge" the correct solution to the tower.
	"Shot" the correct solution  from the tower on the object will destroy it.
	"Shot" wrong decision from the tower will accelerate the movement of the object to the core.
